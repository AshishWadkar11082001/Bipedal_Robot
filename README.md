## Project: Design, 3D Print, Assemble, and Code for Bipedal Robot

In this project, I took on the task of designing and modeling a bipedal robot from scratch. After finalizing the design, I used 3D printing to create its individual parts. Working meticulously, I then assembled these parts into a functional robot body, ensuring each piece fit together seamlessly.

Additionally, I delved into coding to program the robot's movements. Collaborating with a team, I fine-tuned the code to enable the robot to walk smoothly and perform its intended actions. This project showcases my abilities in creative design, precise 3D printing, hands-on assembly, and programming. The end result is a fully functional bipedal robot, reflecting my comprehensive skills in various aspects of robotics.
